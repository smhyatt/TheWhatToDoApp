# The What To Do Game APP


TheWhatToDoGameApp is a game for people who are bored and want inspiration on what to do. The app will guide you on how to use it. You can get one random selected thing to do, or if you are a curious cat, you can see them all. This app was part of a final assignment during the course Mobile App Development at ITU Copenhagen, 2021.


The app:

- contains a user interface,
- contains a scrollable list using RecyclerView,
- works in both portrait and landscape mode by applying Fragments,
- has an internal SQLite database and
- uses animation.
